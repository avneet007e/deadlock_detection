          <p class="card__text">A lock variable provides the simplest synchronisation mechanism for processes. It is software mechanism implemented in user mode. It is busy waiting solution that keeps CPU busy even when its technically waiting. If lock=0, CS is vacant otherwise it is occupied.</p>

          <p class="card__text">Also known as Strict Alteration Approach, is the software mechanism implemented at user mode. It is busy waiting solution which can be implemented for two processes. A turn variable is used which is actually a lock. It is shared varibale between two processes.</p>

          <p class="card__text">It is software based Solution. It has two shared variable for interest and turn. It is solution for mutual exclusion, progress and bounded waiting as only one process allowed in CS and every process gets a fair chance and no process blocks other process from entering CS.</p>

          <p class="card__text">It is a classical multi-process synchronisation problem. There is one producer and one consumer. Producer is producing some items until buffer is full, whereas consumer consumes the item until buffer is empty. They share same memory buffer which is of fixed size. But both cannot access the memory buffer at the same time.</p>

          <p class="card__text">There are 5 philosophers sharing a circular table and they eat and think alternatively. There is a bowl of rice for each philosophers and 5 chopsticks. A philosopher needs both their right and left chopstick to eat. A philosopher may eat if there are both chopsticks available else puts down their chopstick and begin thinking again.</p>
